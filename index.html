      <p id="maptext">Innovative technologies have
        given rise to new ways to
        manage migration. These
        technologies are often
        deployed for purposes of
        efficiency, surveillance and
        tracking.<br/><br/>
        This tool tracks the
        development and deployment
        of technology in the migration
        sector to manage the flow of
        people across borders. The
        tool aims to capture key
        players, potential violations
        and leaders in the industry.</p>
